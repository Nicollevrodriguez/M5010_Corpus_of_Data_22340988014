0,"In college I met a girl at a house party. We drank and talked. Drank and talked. Drank and talked. Starting kissing. Tongues and all. 

She asked me to the restroom with her. Of course, I said. She took me by the hand and led me away.  I went in first and she shut the door behind her and locked it. 

I was certain things were about to go to the next level. She said hang on and unzipped her pants. Sat down on the toilet. 

I thought she had to pee. Then she grunted. I heard a fart. Then a plop. 

I unlocked the door and ran. Never saw her again.",2023-09-30 00:25:52,37468,stories,CardiffGiant1212,submission,I thought she took me to the restroom to have sex.

1,"Well, a couple of weeks ago I found out that my wife cheated on me 6 years ago, the way I found out is that her sister told me after going to visit her to find out how the delivery of her first child was, she confessed to me that 6 years ago my wife told her that she slept drunk with her best friend, in her words, my wife was very sorry.

&#x200B;

At the time she told me I was with my ""son"" and immediately after leaving her house I went to take a paternity test with him, fearing the worst.

&#x200B;

A week later I get the results and my fears came true, my son is not mine, for some reason, I began to see the boy differently, more as an acquaintance than a son, with proofs in hand I confronted my wife at night when the child was sleeping, she asked me who told me and I simply told her that it is none of her business, although obviously it will not take long to connect the dots that it was her sister, well, that is not my problem now.

&#x200B;

Regardless of that, I asked her for a divorce, which is now in process, she was ""devastated"", she swore to me more than once that nothing happened with anyone again, that she has been faithful to me in body and soul since then, I held back the urge to insult her to avoid complications during the divorce issue, not believing a word she said, mostly blaming the alcohol instead of taking the blame herself.

&#x200B;

After talking about it, she threatened me saying that she would demand full custody of the child, I was so annoyed at that moment that I told her okay, I don't want anything to do with something that is not mine, that she keep the child and I'll keep the dogs (we have two dogs that we adopted as puppies and they are currently 8 years old each) after my words she tried to convince me to take care of the child with her, that I am his father, at that moment I exploded, I was so angry and I had held back so much the urge to scream that I just yelled her to go and take her bastard with her.

&#x200B;

A week has passed since that and I am at home (it is in my name because it is a gift from my parents), she went to her parents' house with her kid, she has not called me since then, she left with everything and the half-asleep kid when I yelled at her, especially since it was the first time I really yelled at her, it sure affected her.

&#x200B;

I talked to my parents and my dad told me that I did the right thing and that I shouldn't be raising something that is not of my blood, and I agree with him, however, the pain is still there, my younger brother told me to write here to entertain myself, I am currently seeing a therapist 3 times a week, who told me that I have already taken the first step, which was to leave behind what causes me pain, it just hurts to know that my family no longer exists.

&#x200B;

Regarding why my sister-in-law told me everything, according to her, she felt guilty seeing me always happy with my son, knowing that he may not be mine, and that the fact that we went to visit her in a moment of weakness caused her to completely break down with guilt, I don't know how true that is, I just know that right now I feel tremendous hatred for my wife and a feeling between pain and resentment for the child, although it's just time to get ahead.

&#x200B;

I just hope the divorce goes smoothly, we have separate financers and properties and if she really asks for child support I have proof that it's not mine, according to my lawyer that's more than enough if she tries a legal process for that, my therapist also recommended that I not see him nor her, that regardless of the child's feelings, I should focus on my own first, that the child is no longer my problem and the sooner I accept it, the better.

2,"My 28 year old sister gave birth to her first daughter 2 weeks ago. I 17f was in the hospital together with my parents and her husband. The birth went pretty smooth, although she was screaming so loud.. I was so excited to be an auntie and holding my newborn niece in my arms was a precious moment. 

Everything seemed fine afterwards . My sister came home about 3 days later and she and her husband stayed with me and my parents as they needed help to take care of the baby. But 2 days after she came home, she was experiencing exhaustion, pain in her body, and she constantly fainting.
She kept insisting that she was fine but our mother said that fainting is not ""fine"" and brought her back to the hospital, where they discovered an infection or internal bleeding or both somewhere in her body and they were unable to treat it in time despite giving her mounds of antibiotics before she passed away 2 days later. 

A week has passed since, and 3 days since the funeral. I can't stop crying and thinking that if the doctors had noticed that something was wrong, my sister could still be alive. 

I loved my sister to death. She was my role model growing up. Now I lost her forever and only have my niece, who is completely unaware of what's going on.

3,"me and my girlfriend,(both 26) have been dating for three years now. my girlfriend is a huge Taylor swift fan and was really excited when she found out taylor would be performing at met life stadium, right near us. I decided to surprise her with taylor swift concert tickets, since i knew she really wanted to go. I called in sick the day the tickets dropped and waited in the ticket master cue for 2 hours. finally when it opened up, i bought two seats, for 400 dollars each, presumably one for her, and another for me. When she came back from work that night i surprised her with the tickets, and she was ecstatic. However, when I claimed i was excited to go with her, she got very confused and claimed she thought the two tickets were for her and her best friend, (who is also a big Taylor swift fan). I was very disappointed since I believed that this was an experience we could do together and it would be something we would remember for the rest of our lives. My girlfriend could tell I was upset and said she would be happy to go with me instead. I told her she should go with whoever she wanted to go with more, and to not go with me just because it was what i had planned. After hearing this my girlfriend immediately called her friend and told her that they were going to the taylor swift concert together (ouch). I told my girlfriend that if her friend wanted to go with her she had to pay the 400 dollars for the ticket and her friend agreed to. While my girlfriend and her friend went together and both had a great time I felt betrayed since she chose her over me. While i know my girlfriend’s bff is a much bigger taylor swift fan than me, i was still excited to go since i’ve never been to a concert before, and i like to listen to some of taylor swifts songs. Like i said before i also believed this would be a memory we could both remember together.

4,"WARNING! don't read this if you have any problems with feces and that kind of shit (pun intended) 
Someone told me that I should share this embarrassing story so here we go. (Disclaimer, English isn't my first language, so I'm sorry for all the spelling/grammar mistakes)

Me [F18] had just gotten in a relationship with my new sweet boyfriend [M20]. 
A little info about me. I have a chronic stomach wound which pops up whenever I'm really stressed. 

The relationship was very new so we were both still quite shy, we had just gotten comfortable enough farting in front of each other tho, and often made a joke out of it. 
About a month into our relationship I had to go to the hospital with my stomach wound, I was there for a week and he was super supportive the whole time. 
When I finally got home from the hospital my body was so weak, I wasn't allowed to drink or eat anything the whole week because of the tests they had to make. Therefore my body had pretty much shut down, nothing had come in, so nothing came out. I got prescribed some laxatives that I took, never having taken them before I didn't know what to expect but it definitely wasn't this! 
We were laying in bed, I was on my side looking at my phone, and he was half sitting up in bed playing RuneScape on his laptop in front of me. I could feel a fart coming, so I looked up into his eyes with a smirk face expression and said: ""I'm shitting!"" 

I meant to say ""I'm farting"" but the words came out wrong.. and so did something else. The moment I said it, I let it all out, still with a smirk face expression looking him right in the eyes. You could hear a wet bubbly sound, and I instantly knew what had happened. My smile fated and my face turned to horror, my hand flew down to stop the flow but it was too late. Boyfriend jumped up and ran to the toilet to bring me paper, he helped me clean up while just laughing hysterically, I was so embarrassed that I couldn't even say anything. 

Later when we sat and talked he told me that it was the most intimidating thing he had ever experienced, the way I looked right into his eyes, he had never felt so dominated in his life. ""Like a monkey shitting in its hand and throwing it"". 
Needless to say we got very quickly comfortable with intimate things like that after this. 
Even tho we've broken up since then and it's been a few years, I'm to this day still just as embarrassed.",2023-09-10 14:07:01,11581,stories,missemusepigen,submission,"I ""accidentally"" shit the bed in front of my boyfriend","['warning', ""n't"", 'read', 'problem', 'feces', 'kind', 'shit', 'pun', 'intended', 'someone', 'told', 'share', 'embarrassing', 'story', 'go', 'disclaimer', 'english', ""n't"", 'first', 'language', ""'m"", 'sorry', 'spelling/grammar', 'mistake', 'f18', 'gotten', 'relationship', 'new', 'sweet', 'boyfriend', 'm20', 'little', 'info', 'chronic', 'stomach', 'wound', 'pop', 'whenever', ""'m"", 'really', 'stressed', 'relationship', 'new', 'still', 'quite', 'shy', 'gotten', 'comfortable', 'enough', 'farting', 'front', 'tho', 'often', 'made', 'joke', 'month', 'relationship', 'go', 'hospital', 'stomach', 'wound', 'week', 'super', 'supportive', 'whole', 'time', 'finally', 'got', 'home', 'hospital', 'body', 'weak', ""n't"", 'allowed', 'drink', 'eat', 'anything', 'whole', 'week', 'test', 'make', 'therefore', 'body', 'pretty', 'much', 'shut', 'nothing', 'come', 'nothing', 'came', 'got', 'prescribed', 'laxative', 'took', 'never', 'taken', ""n't"", 'know', 'expect', 'definitely', ""n't"", 'laying', 'bed', 'side', 'looking', 'phone', 'half', 'sitting', 'bed', 'playing', 'runescape', 'laptop', 'front', 'could', 'feel', 'fart', 'coming', 'looked', 'eye', 'smirk', 'face', 'expression', 'said', '``', ""'m"", 'shitting', ""''"", 'meant', 'say', '``', ""'m"", 'farting', ""''"", 'word', 'came', 'wrong', '..', 'something', 'else', 'moment', 'said', 'let', 'still', 'smirk', 'face', 'expression', 'looking', 'right', 'eye', 'could', 'hear', 'wet', 'bubbly', 'sound', 'instantly', 'knew', 'happened', 'smile', 'fated', 'face', 'turned', 'horror', 'hand', 'flew', 'stop', 'flow', 'late', 'boyfriend', 'jumped', 'ran', 'toilet', 'bring', 'paper', 'helped', 'clean', 'laughing', 'hysterically', 'embarrassed', 'could', ""n't"", 'even', 'say', 'anything', 'later', 'sat', 'talked', 'told', 'intimidating', 'thing', 'ever', 'experienced', 'way', 'looked', 'right', 'eye', 'never', 'felt', 'dominated', 'life', '``', 'like', 'monkey', 'shitting', 'hand', 'throwing', ""''"", 'needle', 'say', 'got', 'quickly', 'comfortable', 'intimate', 'thing', 'like', 'even', 'tho', ""'ve"", 'broken', 'since', ""'s"", 'year', ""'m"", 'day', 'still', 'embarrassed']",0.6114883397473658,0.5180450879015785,0.5935883723916279

 Well, when she made her big announcement I replied by saying I’ve been cheating on her for the entirety of our relationship, which isn’t true.

6,"When my daughter was 5 years old, and just starting kindergarten I would occasionally tell my daughter ""Just remember, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old"".

Wishful thinking, I know.

I told her this her first day of kindergarten, and she replied ""okay daddy"".

Then I would tell her the same thing every once in a while.  Not too often to be annoying, but often enough that she knew my rule.

Then one day, later in the school year (it may even have been when she was in 1st grade) as I was getting ready to drop her off at school, once again I said to her ""remember now, no dating and no boyfriends until you turn 30 years old"".

This time she had a totally different reply.

She turned to me, and looked right at me with those eyes that she could use to get whatever she wanted from her dad, and said ""Well, if I get good grades all through school and college, can I start dating when I am 29""?

It took all the willpower I had to not smile and start laughing when she asked that. With a very serious look on my face, I showed her that I was taking a moment to consider what she had just asked.

Then I replied to her ""Hmmm.....Well okay, you've got a deal. If you get good grades all through school and college I will let you start dating at 29"".

She replied, ""okay daddy"", got out of the car, and bounced her way on into school for the day.

For those who are going to ask, yes she waited till she was 29 to start dating, because she always followed daddy's rules.

Just kidding.

She had her first boyfriend at around 13 years old, breaking her Daddy's heart.

7,"Four days ago I was walking with a coworker on a break just to stretch our legs. We work in an office setting so like to get up every once in a while and get some fresh air. We walk in a half circle around the building. In the back there are stairs that we like to go down and then back up on our way back for exercise. It's two sets of 15 concrete steps.

It was a beautiful sunny day with blue skies. Near the top of the stairs we were in mid-conversation while heading down and all of a sudden I hear him go ""Oh god"" and trip and fall somehow. He rolled down and landed at the bottom in a heap, face first in the concrete. I just stared for a few seconds because it was so sudden. I ran to the bottom while asking if he's ok, but he didn't move or respond. I got close and realized there was blood coming from his head and face and his arms and legs were seized up and stiff when I tried to roll him over.

I freaked out but managed to call 911 while also texting another coworker friend of mine to come outside the office because our friend fell. 911 told me to roll him over and do CPR while they came, which I did.

The ambulance got there about 7 minutes after I called and took him to the hospital, but I'm 99% sure he was already dead when I was doing CPR

I feel really weird about it. Like sad, but also just strange. It's hard to put into words. It doesn't seem real. I will get flashes where I realize what happened and feel an intense tightness in my chest and the severity of it hits me. I keep imagining him laying at the bottom of the stairs face down, and also his torn up face when I was giving him CPR when he was already dead. It's also just really sad because he was one of my best friends at work. I've barely slept since Tuesday, and was full of adrenaline for a full day after it happened.

He was single with no kids or anything. Only has a brother and father who live in other states.

I don't really know why I'm writing all this but I just feel really strange and am wondering if anyone ever experienced something like this.

EDIT: Didn't expect this post to get so much traction. I appreciate all the advice and positive thoughts sent my way. It saddens me that many of you have similar experiences. I can't respond to every comment but I am reading every single one.

8,"Edit: Reading through the comments made me realize I screwed up the title.

It should probably be: My boyfriend made me realize I was bi

I(24f) thought I was a lesbian until I met my boyfriend(20m). My whole life until last year, I've only dated women, and I get grossed out thinking of myself with a guy. My boyfriend and I met at an event we both volunteered for, and we became friends. We got closer, and I started thinking about him more and more. When I realized that I developed feelings for him, it terrified me. My whole life, I'd thought I was a lesbian, and then I developed feelings for a guy. Everything I knew was wrong. I tried distancing myself from him in hopes the feelings would go away, but they didn't. I kept thinking about him, and I eventually gave in and asked him out. Once I convinced him that I wasn't joking, he accepted, and we started dating.

Dating him wasn't that different than dating a girl. The sex was so weird, but he was so accommodating. The first couple of times, he made sure I was comfortable and he was so careful and gentle. The thought of me with any other guy still grosses me out, but being with my boyfriend makes me feel warm and fuzzy inside. I have no idea why he's the only guy I like, but the year we've been together has been probably the best year of my life. He gets me, and he gives the best hugs. We live together, and he's an amazing roommate and an amazing boyfriend.

9,"Hi, I'm a 35 year old woman married to a 45 year old man for over 7 years. We have 4 beautiful kids. My husband recently had his birthday this week. I surprised him with a pregnancy test result that we will be having a 5th child. He seemed to have a meltdown when he heard it and he said no, it is impossible, we have been careful. I thought he would be happy as he said it himself when we were dating that he wants a lot of kids. I calmed him down somehow... Yesterday, I went with my husband to the gynecologist to have my sonogram and the doctor says I am 10 weeks pregnant and we are having twins. My husband was livid. He keeps screaming no no no no no. I lost count of him saying no. After his meltdown at doctors office he told me that he just can't have 6 kids at his age. I got confused as what he is saying- as I know he wanted a big family. he wanted it himself. I cried and told him what are we supposed to do and he keep saying that he just can't have 6 kids. On our way home he says how he should not have gotten married and have kids and he does not know anymore if his life is worth it, that he'd be happy to have a reset button. I got so mad I told him that it takes two to tango, that creating a kid is not just my fault. Today I woke up with screaming and crying kids begging their father to not go. Turns out he already packed and ready to go. My 3 year old is hugging his fathers luggage and crying and his face is stoic. By then I knew I was stupid to committing a mistake of marrying him. It maybe hard as I am pregnant right now, but I got a full time job and we do have a nanny and supportive family and friends. It is best if he go, I do not need another baby to take care of. So, to my dear soon to be ex-husband Jerry, F\*CK YOU. don't come back.
